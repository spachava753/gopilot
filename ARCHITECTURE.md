# Ideas
- utilize temporal for persistence, orchestration and workflows
- utilize Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- utilize packer for creating VM images
- MVP for cloud backends would be AWS and GCP
- use concept of clusters
  - cluster is just one-long lived workflow
- on user client (such as laptop), store state in local config folder
- add option to search and reuse control-tower across clouds?
